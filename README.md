## Laboratory Activity 1 - Hypertext Markup Language

For this activity, we were tasked to create a table showing our schedule using only HTML and inline/internal styles. For the design, I opted for a minimalistic design that uses solid-colored shapes.

## Laboratory Activity 2 - Cascading Style Sheets

For this activity, we were tasked to create our own personal vision board. For the design, I opted for ragged and sharp-edged shapes with animations that make the
design look dynamic and feel reactive.

## Laboratory Activity 3 - JavaScript

For this activity, we were tasked to create a web page that can count sentences and words from the user's input. For the design, I opted for a "zen" feeling
to make the typing experience as relaxing and calming for users, hence the background, sound effects, and subtle animation effects.

## Laboratory Activity 4 - Responsive Web Design

For this activity, we were tasked to improve our output for Exercise Activity 2, which turned to be a personal page. For the design, I opted to use different
design techniques which mainly revolved around the idea of "photo cards," hence the use of card-like shapes all throughout the page.
